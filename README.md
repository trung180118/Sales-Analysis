Hi, thank you for taking a look at my project! This repository contains a case study on sales analysis that aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of sales data from hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

The case study involves a hypothetical scenario where we wants to analyze the sales data to identify areas of improvement and make data-driven decisions to increase revenue. This process include cleaning the 12 months of sales data, then transform them by adding more columns and lastly, answer the 5 business questions.

The repository contains the following files:

1. Sales_Analysis_Report: A detailed documentation of the case study, including the objectives, methodology, questions and key findings.

2. Data folder: Contains the dataset used in the analysis.

3. Analysis file: Contains the Jupyter Notebook used to perform the analysis. The notebook includes data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations including tables and charts.

Should you want to run the code you need to download all source files into the same folder and change the filepaths in the code accoding to the filepath on your device.
